gulp-concat
cssnano insted of gulp-cssnano
autoprefixer insted of gulp-autoprefixer


If you’ve used Gulp before, you might be wondering why I’m using straight-up autoprefixer and cssnano, instead of gulp-autoprefixer and gulp-cssnano. For some reason, using them will work, but will prevent sourcemaps from working. Read more about that issue: <https://github.com/gulp-sourcemaps/gulp-sourcemaps/issues/60>


não deu certo e voltei os pacotes! Testando!
